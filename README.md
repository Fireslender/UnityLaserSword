Unity Laser Sword - Volumetric Laser Sword in Unity.

I made every effort to get this on the asset store but it was denied multiple times, even though other "laser sword" assets made it on the store somehow. I love the consistency there...

I spent a few weeks putting this laser sword together for Unity. The asset store won't host it because of copyright issues, so now it's freely available on GitHub!

The blade is fully volumetric (including glow), with a nice rim shader.
